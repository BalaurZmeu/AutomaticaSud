# Mini RoboticArm

This is a project for controlling a miniature robotic arm remotely over a WiFi network. The system is built using the Robotdyn UNO+WiFi hybrid board, which integrates the Arduino ATmega328 and ESP8266 microcontrollers. The ESP8266 hosts a simple web interface with control buttons, allowing the operator to manage the arm's movements from any device connected to the same local WiFi network.
