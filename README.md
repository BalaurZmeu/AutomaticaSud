# Mini RoboticArm

This is a project for controlling a miniature robotic arm remotely over a WiFi network. The system is built using the ESP8266 microcontroller. The ESP8266 hosts a simple web interface with control buttons, allowing the operator to manage the arm's movements from any device (smartphone or laptop) connected to the same local WiFi network. The operator should connect to the local WiFi network and access the page **http://robot.local**.
